					<hr class = "bluehr">
					<p class ="missiondesc">   The Marketing Branch is a platform for high school students to become trained in the practices of effective and professional marketing through hands-on experience with participating local businesses and guidance under an experienced senior Intern Manager. Student Interns are asked to utilize the knowledge they have gained through the program to provide marketing services to small, developing businesses partnered with their city’s regional Marketing Agency. A cut of the earnings generated from each regional Marketing Agency will be channeled directly into the Incubator sector of Foundation Ventures, which serves to foster the dreams of young entrepreneurs and fund local city government projects. (Read more about the Incubator here.) Our core centers of operations in the Bay Area are Fremont, Palo Alto, and San Ramon. </p>

					<hr class = "bluehr">
					<p class ="missiondesc">The Conference and Events Branch is in charge of hosting educational outreach programs that help high school students gain exposure to an entrepreneurship mindset and skillset, and network with other business-oriented students and established business executives of the industry. Through conferences hosted by the Conference and Events Branch, young entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to meet with top notch business executives speakers as well as create lasting connections with other students interested or passionate about business. This branch is sponsored by McKinsey & Co, Draper University, Tivix, Y Combinator, and SiliconVal.ly. As with the Marketing Agency, a cut of the profits generated by the Conference and Events Branch from the conferences will be allocated to the Incubator sector of Foundation Ventures. </p>

					<p class ="missiondesc">The Incubator branch of the company focuses on taking the funds generated from the other two branches to be channeled into funding startups by high schoolers or other worthy ventures (projects by the local state gov that require funding). Mainly though, it focuses on helping high schoolers develop their own enterprises, something that no other professional incubator allows for. For instance, we’ll hold professional pitch comps that decide on whether a high school enterprise will receive funding, or a high school enterprise can reach out to us for potential funding. </p>

					<hr class = "bluehr">
					<p class ="missiondesc"> The Newspaper branch of the company is a publication that focuses on improving financial literacy and business awareness in aspiring young entrepreneurs or students interested in business. As opposed to conventional business outlets, which caters towards established business professionals with extensive knowledge about financial literacy and important business concepts, this outlet caters specifically to students or individuals who might otherwise not be as aware. </p>
